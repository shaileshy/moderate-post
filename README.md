# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Project Task`
GET data from the following API:
Posts API (GET) - jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Method - Use raw fetch or axios or any other method of your choice
The purpose of this frontend is to see the lists of Posts and the comments made on the posts, so
that a moderator can view the comments and select them for moderation.
Once all data is fetched from the given API, display it on the screen.
User can add comments to the fetched posts. The comments can be selected for moderation
(approval/rejection). Multiple comments can be selected and sent for moderation
Sections: Wall section for getting and displaying all posts & moderation section for showing
selected moderated comments (comments in all section should reflect a status called moderated
on it, if it is also selected for moderation) - Can select multiple comments for moderation by
enabling a button called Select-All feature. Add a Load-more feature which will add additional 15
records to the list, along with initial 15 records
User select comments for moderation using checkbox and assign them to moderation section
Predictive search in all section to search posts and comments (you can create a custom
component or any lib) drop-down should only show 10 matching records at a time [You can add a
2 or 3 seconds debounce, considering you're fetching it from an API in real-world (OPTIONAL)] -
drop-down to filter comments from newest first to oldest and vice versa.
